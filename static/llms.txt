# SkillGuard: SSL for Agent Skills
> Verifiable AI skill safety classification with zero-knowledge ML proofs

## What this API does
SkillGuard classifies AI agent skills as SAFE, CAUTION, DANGEROUS, or MALICIOUS.
Every classification includes a mandatory cryptographic zkML proof (SNARK via Jolt/Dory)
that anyone can verify independently. Think of it as an SSL certificate for agent skills:
the proof guarantees the classification was computed correctly by the neural network.

## Authentication
- x402 payment: $0.001 USDC on Base per classification (no API key needed)
- Or: Bearer token via Authorization header

## Endpoints

### Classify a skill (paid)
POST /api/v1/evaluate
Content-Type: application/json

By name (looks up skill on ClawHub):
{"skill": "skill-slug-name"}

With full data:
{"skill": {"name": "my-skill", "version": "1.0.0", "author": "alice", "description": "A skill", "skill_md": "# My Skill\nDoes something useful.", "scripts": [], "files": []}}

Response includes: classification, decision, confidence, class scores, reasoning, and a zkML proof bundle.

### Verify a proof (free, no auth)
POST /api/v1/verify
Content-Type: application/json
{"proof_b64": "...", "program_io": {...}}

Returns: {"valid": true, "verification_time_ms": 74}

### Health check (free)
GET /health

### Usage statistics (free)
GET /stats

### OpenAPI spec
GET /openapi.json

### Agent discovery manifest
GET /.well-known/ai-plugin.json

## Pricing
$0.001 USDC per classification on Base (EIP-155 chain 8453).
Payment via x402 protocol (HTTP 402 flow with ERC-3009 TransferWithAuthorization).
Verification is always free.

## Example: one-shot classify
curl -X POST https://skillguard.onrender.com/api/v1/evaluate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"skill": "4claw"}'

## Model
